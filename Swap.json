      "question": "What is AutoTax?",
      "highlighted": true,
      "answer": "Frequently, DeFi tokens include a “tax”, which is a percentage of the trade value that goes towards things like staking rewards and project treasuries. This tax can sometimes cause problems for traders as it can put trades outside of their desired slippage, causing the transaction to fail.",
      "secondAnswer":"AutoTax takes care of this by automatically adding token tax to a trade's slippage (up to a specified limit which is configurable in the settings)",

      "question": "How do I make my transaction go through quicker?",
