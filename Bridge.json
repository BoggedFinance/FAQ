      "question": "Why can I only bridge the BOG token?",
      "answer": "The BOG token is the governance token of the Bogged Ecosystem, and is used for bridging, tool payments and more. Currently, it is only possible to bridge the BOG token, but you can use BogSwap to swap to/from any token you wish, before and after bridging, making Bogged a perfect platform for moving value between blockchains.",

      "question": "How does the Bogged DeFi Bridge work?",
      "answer": "When “sending” BOG to another chain, it is burned on the sending chain and minted on the receiving chain, only after multiple security checks and validations. The BOG is sent to the same address that initiated the transaction, but on the receiving chain.",
      "secondAnswer":"BOG is only minted after several security checks, including waiting for 20 network validations. This makes the bridge resistant to malicious attacks that have afflicted other bridge providers, and provides peace of mind for users of the Bogged platform.",
